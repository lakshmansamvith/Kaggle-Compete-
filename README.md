# Kaggle-Compete-
Kaggle Competetion Notebooks 

## Competition 1- Titanic Dataset
Answer.csv consists of PassengerID and predicted values for Survived <br/>
The accuracy of the model is not so good, this was my first competition.<br/>

## Competition 2- Advanced Housing Price Regressions. 
Housing Price.csv is the file I submitted. <br/>
In the first attempt without much trial I got a score of 0.1594, I will further make changes to the notebook

### In Kaggle, for all the regression problems the highest sore is 0 while for classification problems the highest score is 1.
Keep in mind that House Pricing is a Regression Problem because the values are continous in nature and cannot be classified into particular values.
